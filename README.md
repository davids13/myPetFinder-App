# myPetFinderApp

This is a community application to provide a platform where the owners can register they lost pet locally (then worldwide).

Further the intent is to add more functionalities to the application like a space where anybody can see all pet's info and start the adoption process.

Tech: Java 11, Java EE, Postgres, JPA, EclipseLink, Junit 5 / Mockito, Payara Server, Maven, Github, Swagger, Docker, Jenkins etc...

Feel free to contribute :)
